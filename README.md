Simple gallery with images of 12 kittens. The pictures within the application are loaded from the drawables folder.
The app has 2 screens. The main screen where a grid with all kittens is displayed, once a picture of a kitten is clicked a full image 
view opens. In the full view we are able to swipe left and right to navigate between individual pictures
